<h2>DrDru's highly opinionated Japanese learning path</h2>   
<br>
<br>
<p>This learning path is not made for everyone. It's made for people who enjoy reading, are happy to skip writing Japanese and enjoy learning with Comprehensible Input much more than Spaced Recognition Systems (SRS). It is organised such that you get multiple exposure to vocabulary in at least two different contexts.
</p>  
<p>
This path is focused on the core steps. The more you do in addition the better : hiring a tutor, listening podcasts, using a textbook, learning Kanji with Wanikani... 
</p>

<p>
<!--In addition I recommend to go back to previously used resource for a better understanding of things you might have missed and to measure how much you've improved on a regular basis.
-->
  All resources mentioned are free.
</p>
<br>

<h4>TLDR : </h4> 

 <ol>
  <li>Learn Katakana and Hiragana</li>
  <li>Interact with the language using Lingodeer or Duolingo</li>
  <li>Read Sakubi</li>
  <li>Start reading Dr Dru's Main Experiment</li>
  <li>Read as any Graded readers as you can</li>
  <li>Confront yourself to native content</li>
  <li>Use an SRS and premade N5 deck</li>
  <li>Start reading NH News web easy</li>
  <li>Read a more in-depth grammar book</li>
</ol> 
<br>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">1-A Learn Katakana</span> : they're a pain, as a new starter highly motivated you want to use your positive energy to learn them.
Read <a href="https://www.imabi.net/katakana.htm">this page about Katakana</a> to understand they are used esssentially for loan words.
Then go to <a href="https://www2.hm.com/ja_jp/index.html">H&M Japan</a> and make an image search in your favourite search engine using the following keyword イタリアンレストランメニュー (Italian restaurant menu). 
<br>
Start reading and realize how much you understand.    
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">1-B Learn hiragana</span>
</p>   


<p></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">2 - Interact with the language using Lingodeer or Duolingo</span>. These apps will teach you basic grammar and vocabulary in a gamified way which is ideal to get you started.

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">3 - Read <a href="https://sakubi.neocities.org/index.html ">Sakubi</a> </span> : a concise introduction to Japanese grammar that will gives you the minimum of theory you need to start with. Its philosophy talks to me. 
<br>
<div style="padding: 15px;">"This grammar guide does its best to give you some basic exposure to japanese grammar. It can't teach you it. It can only expose you to it. Your job is to turn that exposure into acquisition. The exposure is just a foot in the door."</div>

</p>


<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">4 - Start reading <a href="https://drdru.github.io/stories/intro.html">Dr Dru's Main Experiment</a> </span> : I have spent the past few years creating comprehensible input for people who just started their Japanese learning journey. At the moment of writing, it will soon be 100 pages long. Assuming an average page introduces 3 words, that will expose you to 300 words within a very short time frame. 
</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">5 - Read as many Graded readers as you can</span> : Ariane from <a href="https://dokushoclub.com/free-reading-resources/n5-free-reading-resources/">Dokushoclub</a> keeps an exhaustive list of the free ones. In these you will have the chance to encounter words learnt  in DrDru's experiment and in Duolingo/Lingodeer once more.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">6 - Confront yourself to native content</span>  like <a href="https://tapas.io/episode/2134872">this relatively easy free comic book</a> and realise how hard it is. Keep coming at it to measure progress.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">7 - Use an SRS with a premade N5 deck</span>. It will consolidate all the vocabulary you've learnt so far along with a few new words. By then you should know most of the words so don't be afraid to add a lot of cards per day. Once you know reasonably well 90%+ of the deck, stop SRSing (I personally think SRS is busy work that wastes precious time which could be used doing something productive or rest). To do that you can use the web version of Memrise. It is free and ad free.
</p>
<br>
At this point you should be around the N5 level.
<br>
<br>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">8-A Start reading NH News web easy</span> : <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/">here</a> : it is a bit overwhelming at first but keep at it for a few weeks and it will become easier and easier. At some point you'll find yourself turning the furigana off. When reading it becomes boring, you're ready to move to something else. 
   <Br>
   <Br>
   Reading NHK easy news daily is so efficient that at this point you don't really need an to consolidate your vocabulary knowledge with an N4 premade deck.
 </p>
In parallel :
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">8-B Read a more in-depth grammar book</span> : <a href="https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/">such as the popular Tae Kim grammar guide</a>.

</p>
<br> 

<p>By now your level should be around the N4 level. 

 </p> 


<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Congratulations ! You just got out of the beginner level, you can now confront yourself to native content. From here onwards you're on your own. Welcome to the Intermediate Plateau(TM).</span> 

</p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Some suggestions : </span>
<br>
<br>
- <a href="https://drdru.github.io/twc.html">Read the Tile world Chronicles</a> : these are N4+ short illustrated stories I write that will get you used to the vocab used in JRPG.
<Br>
<Br>
- Sign up to Wanikani forum and join one of their bookclubs
</p>

<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A Final Word</span>
<br>
<br>
Creating short stories in Easy Japanese has helped me a lot. I'd recommend doing the same sooner than later. I also encourage you to get them proofread and to publish them in a friendly format (bonus point if you can add illustrations) to help future learners. If every learner was to write just one and make it public, acquisition of the Japanese language would be a solved problem.
