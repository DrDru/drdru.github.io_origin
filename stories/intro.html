<h2>Welcome to DrDru's main experiment</h2>
What follows has two goals :<br>
 <ul>
  <li>prove that you can learn japanese without using your mother tongue</li>
  <li>make it a fun experience</li>

 </ul>
<br>
Before starting make sure you're comfortable with hiragana and katakana.
<br> 
Not everything will be clear the first time you see it and it's OK. Keep scrolling. It will become clear eventually.
<br>
Despite being in the form of stories the Japanese used is beginner Japanese and may not reflect the way native speakers would express themselves.
<br>
As the vocabulary and grammar expands it becomes closer to native speech.
<br>
<!--
Before starting :<br>
 <ul>
  <li>be sure that you know your hiraganas and katakanas</li>
  <li>mobile phone users please rotate your phone to landscape mode</li>
  <li>desktop users please zoom in to the appropriate level</li>
 </ul>
 -->
 
 <p><span class="red">Warning : what follows has been proofread by a native speaker but there may still be some mistakes left. 
 <br>
 By clicking start you acknowledge it and agree to continue at your own risk !!!
