<p>I write everything in easy Japanese since my work is targeted to Japanese learners.</p>
 

<p>My work being very atypical and in a foreign language there are not a lot of people I know with whom I can share it and that's the hard part. My friends and relative do not understand the test, it's not really a comic book so I can't really share it as such and the Japanese learning community has mixed feelings about it.</p>


<p>
I can't draw so I have had to find ways to produce visuals that don't require drawing.  My stories use two styles. I like them both. The one with the emoji is more dynamic than the other which allows me to better display emotions. The one using pixel art is easies to sell if you see what I mean.
