Jenova does not say a word
Cyberpunk and fantasy
Play sephiroth and get a feel of his power
Know what this song feels like? It's like going back to your hometown only to find out the things you've loved have started to fade away. The tree where you and the kids gather to play, the starry skies you can no longer see, that favorite spot at the rooftop where you used to take your alone time when you needed it and even the people themselves whom you're unsure if you'll ever meet again. You've grown, you've grown apart the things in the past which built you who you are today are changing. And now some very dear things you've treasured burned to the ground, all the hard work, all the love, care and effort you put just to make your dreams come true. The smiles you've made and shared with everyone along the way all gone. They're all in the past now. Once again, you grow, you look up, you smile and think "I'll treasure these memories, for as long as I still have these memories we are all still together". Still, you take comfort in the fact that there is still hope, then as you gain another hint of strength you press forward.

Push one gourp to destroy th eother but braodcast sthe transmissions.

Start lik e after 3 years have passed. Sofia in charge of training, Nikolo of trade. Butterrs is in admiration. Takes power ~because old peeps don't want to go far enough for the community. New runes can e video or image qualit. There is power 
in the stones. They don't want to share the stones at scale. Start at sort of PHD graduation


Leran magic by studying nature. Start war bc want to get rid of espers and old magic.

Espers are bothered by the netwrok of runes. Espers were in hybernation since the last war.
Witches makes pan come back. He helps everyone run away on the bahamut miuntain.

Course poursuite dans le Wasteland. Dechetterie

Show how the rebel group in nerobi is composed.

Add an episode in which the power of the runes is explored ?

Faelea order think they can create a new esper.
the reason Jinedine is here is because the Markus has asked the King in Nerobi to send troups to re open the trade route.
Markus knows his men can;t do it because of Runes. He also hope the Army in Neorbi gets spread.

The plain under Nerobi are very fertile. South of the river is desert land

contrebandier vs normal marchand don tlike each other

Contrebandier talkds to herald and pretend he is not
Contrebandier preapre as mission and goes to a shop
Boat innspection. Everything ok but the merchant is not happy
Damages boat


Pirate with crew take herald and big Knight on board
At some point they meet rascal (his friend who died)

Shall they take a merchant ? Yes ?
Which port do they leave from ?
Is the Herald from Nerobi or from Bardo.

Herald is ambassador 

Start by a letter and then yes boss ! we leave in two days


Captain see anogher matelot who is not is friend and damages his boat. That's why the herald comes

The guy who buys mythril is the merchant 



Mec sur le bateau qui fait de la contrebande a pas la choix que d embarquer un inspecteur et doit cacher ce qu il fait emme quand il ravitalle sur des petites iles 

Il les pousse a aidre un bateau en detresse

The trafficker goes to a pirate island to find the 3 women that are hiding. 10 years before Aryn was born
They land and then have to go to the town (a few fights to get there)

Go to the forest where there are mini quest like find a shovel to remove a stone

Then find a camp of treasure hunter search for rackam the red treasure
Then have to go into the mountain to find the hiding pirate women

Have a partner that you never meet again like the gosht in train in ff6


Two good endings. One positive, one very bad everyone fails and the runes take over the world. 
and they are known as dangerous rebels in the future


Find where Rena's castke is
DArius and berenice mythril vs manufatcured goods.
Forges
The queen is called Madeline
Tax import fish

Dans Nerobi tout le monde se sent surveille. Les gens sont parfaits mais vont dans des endroits dodgy sans runes.

There is a temple in Nerobi where Juju goes. She feels a great old power right in the heart of the city.

The temple de l order de fae lea est a la croise des elements : riviere, wind fire

In Nerobi le povoir politique est impuissant


First esper war due to mages. Juju's artefact are actually the one that created the first war.

Chokobo esper is master of chokobos

High herbs with a town within comme dans les trolls (la mer d herbe)

First men vivent dans les montagnes ou aucun pouvoir ne fonctionne

Show how Nerobi was full of diversity but the runes create polarisation 

Riches get runes first
Rich proprietaire terriens vs farmers vs artisans.
Juju et Zin arrivent dans une ville type dunkerk et arrivent a nerobi via les fermes


La ville californie est ridicule avec les gens qui font du yoga etc

Phoenix shows open emoji town to Juju ?
https://www.spiderforest.com/comics?order=Newest

Add characters stats

We find the real reason of contrebande later.

In Nerobi gruads blocking aisles a la ff7

There are towns along the main river of the continent


Add 'action' part comme quand ils grimpent le poteau du wall market

Ingenieur poursuivi poru avoir hacker les runes. HE participe a la contrebande de sake. He creates device to see through the runes in a short range radius

Jinedine fait une tentaive desespere de tuer le bad guy with 100% chance of failure because he is choked that his borther died

JuJu is saveed by teh phoenix. She has a special relationship with him since she's been looking for artifect

Arya grows stronger but the stronger she is the kinder she becomes / and misses her family++

Caith Sith will help Jinedin

Juju and the engineer may work together on new runes

Or the engineer and the sailor work on a new kind of boat (I prefer)

&#128481; Have a miner using a pick axe as a weapon

Juju's quest to find the artefact would make an interes3ting story.
Juju tells Zinedine that she leaves him there.



Roktudy Nerobu Fae lea plaine de rainen Ninphea

Re use : oh I read a story about an animal concert


Have a crafter as a character. Craft can be sunglasses or amulet... 

The sword becomes stronger and stronger with Juju's magic.
Shop you can use the sword with magic


Economy : Neroby is a trade center.


They land on Arya's Island where everyone is a chicken and foreigners are not welcome (Brexit)

Then they go to NErobi and on the way they stop in Juju's town where they learn her past. And meet the friend she lost ?

Then they reach Nerobi. They go to the king and the Engineer shuts down the city. They flee to the EAst and some bandit tell them they can help to escape. They follow. They meet the cat esper and the engineer there. Then they go to the very old forest witht the unicorn and the wolf. There are elves who help the espers. No one can go through the forest.

Then they reach the temple.  They split in two ? Some go to the cavern in the east wher ethey meet the people whose skin burns in the sun.

They go underground and meeet heir next friend. And they deliver Zinedine' Bro.

The other goup ? Meets the openemoji people ? Something just happened to them

In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the new. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends.
