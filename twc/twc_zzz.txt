Then they reach Nerobi. They go to the king and the Engineer shuts down the city. They flee to the EAst and some bandit tell them they can help to escape. They follow. They meet the cat esper and the engineer there. Then they go to the very old forest witht the unicorn and the wolf. There are elves who help the espers. No one can go through the forest.

They go underground and meeet heir next friend. And they deliver Zinedine' Bro.


The other goup ? Meets the poenemoji people ? Something just happened to them


My work is very unusual. It's composed of pixel art illustrated stories published as HTML pages on my website and written in easy Japanese. 

I have been learning Japanese for a while and like every learner realises quickly, there is not much high quality enjoyable comprehensible input (ie written using only easy words/grammar) 
out there and it's sad because that's (to me) the most effective way to learn a new language. And since I am reasonable person decided that doing it was a task for me...
So I thought hard about it and came with this amazing idea that I would teach Japanese in Japanese, introducing new words with emoji and reusing them over and over in genuinely enjoyable stories.

After a lot of hard work I shared it on the dedicated section of reddit and was expecting praise, success and glory for my genius. 
I got 45 upvotes when photos by someoneone who just received their textbook got 1,000. That did not stop me. I was thinking people did not see the big picture and if I keep doing more of this they would and they will be impressed.
So I continued and kept sharing with no real success. After what might be 6 months of relatively hard work I stopped. Another 6 months later I randomly decided to take an other look at my site.
And read it from the first to the last page. And I could not help but think that it was really good. Definitely something I'd have enjoyed had I not been the author.

So I started again for something like another 18 months. I got some people genuinely praising my work but from what I'd call a marketing point of view it is definitely a failure. 
My site is very rarely shared or mentioned. I still do care a little about it but not that much anymore. I am now doing it for me and for the handful of people who find it interesting and especially for this one person who one day will find it and think 'OMG this is all I have ever wanted' :-). 

In any case it's been a very rich experience of which the details do not really belong here.

What matters is that at some point I used pixel art in addition to emoji to introduce new words 



I had started writing a very long post but then realised it was a rant about how unfair it 


I am a big fan of Final Fantasy 6 and 7. I genuinely think they are two of the greatest realisation of humankind.

I have been waiting for 25+ years for someone to produce something with the same vibe. Turns out it hasn't happened so I decided to do it...

My stories take place in your typical fantasy world but with two additional features. Magical creatures (Espers if you know FF) are present as well as a new technology. This new technology consists of Runestones that can be engraved and placed into devices/jewels that serve as interface. Essentially it is a metaphore for smartphones adapted to a fantasy world.  


I can't draw so I have had to find ways to produce visuals that don't require drawing.  My stories use two styles. I like them both. The one with the emoji is more dynamic than the other which allows me to better display emotions. The one using pixel art is easies to sell if you see what I mean. 

I write everything in easy Japanese since my work is targeted to Japanese learners. 



My work being very atypical and in a foreign language there are not a lot of people I know with whom I can share it and that's the hard part. My friends and relative do not understand the test, it's not really a comic book so I can't really share it as such and the Japanese learning community has mixed feelings about it.
